The calculation part is by help of the article: First-order perturbative calculation of the frequency-shifts caused by static cylindrically-symmetric electric and magnetic imperfections of a Penning trap by Jochen K. At first of the coding, we prompt user to enter all the variables: q, V0, m, B0, d, c1, c2 and z0. Besides, it will also check that the variables obey the conditions of trapping.

With the variables and the equations founded in calculation part, the we can find all the frequencies and by the help of frequencies, we can compute the trajectory in x, y and z-direction. Hence, with those equations, we can plot the graph and the animation present.
